<p>The Dead Sea Scrolls refers to ancient Jewish and Hebrew manuscripts discovered at the Qumran Caves in what was then Mandatory Palestine, near Ein Feshkha in the West Bank,
    on the northern shore of the Dead Sea.the Dead Sea Scrolls are considered to be a keystone in the history of archaeology with great historical, religious, and linguistic significance because they
    include the oldest surviving manuscripts of entire books later included in the biblical canons, along with
    deuterocanonical and extra-biblical manuscripts which preserve evidence of the diversity of religious thought in late Second Temple Judaism. Sadly, owing to the poor condition of some of
    the scrolls, scholars have not identified all of their texts.</p>
