<p>The tomb of Tutankhamun, also known by its tomb number, KV62, is the burial place of Tutankhamum, a pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty of ancient Egypt,
    in the Valley of the Kings. The tomb consists of four chambers and an entrance staircase and corridor. It is smaller and less extensively decorated than other Egyptian royal tombs of its time,
    and it probably originated as a tomb for a non-royal individual that was adapted for Tutankhamun's use after his premature death.Tutankhamun's tomb was discovered
    in 1922 by excavators led by Howard Carter. As a result of the quantity and spectacular appearance of the burial goods, the tomb attracted a media frenzy and became the most famous find
    in the history of Egyptology. The death of Carter's patron, the Earl of Carnarvon, in the midst of the excavation process inspired speculation that the tomb was cursed.</p>
